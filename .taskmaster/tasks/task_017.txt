# Task ID: 17
# Title: Setup frontend architecture foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure React Router, React Query, and form handling
# Details:
Configure React Router for navigation. Set up React Query for API integration with proper error handling. Configure react-hook-form with Zod validation. Implement authentication context and hooks. Set up error boundary and global error handling. All frontend architecture must be self-documenting through clear component and hook names.

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCES:**
- Follow frontend architecture patterns from docs/project-plan.md Phase 4 requirements
- Configure environment variables for frontend following docs/environment-variables.md VITE_ prefix guidelines
- Implement comprehensive testing using AAA pattern per docs/testing-strategy.md

# Test Strategy:
Routing works, API calls succeed, forms validate correctly, testing follows AAA pattern from docs/testing-strategy.md, and frontend code is comment-free

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure React Router and navigation structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up React Router with route definitions and navigation components
### Details:
Install and configure React Router v6. Create route definitions for main app sections. Implement navigation components (header, sidebar). Set up protected routes for authenticated areas. Configure route guards and redirects. Follow frontend architecture from docs/project-plan.md and use environment configuration from docs/environment-variables.md. Route and component names should clearly indicate their navigation purpose.

## 2. Set up React Query for API state management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Configure React Query with proper error handling and caching
### Details:
Install and configure React Query client. Set up query client with default options for caching and retries. Implement global error handling for API calls. Create custom hooks for common API patterns. Configure dev tools for debugging. Use API base URL from docs/environment-variables.md VITE_ configuration. Hook and query key names should clearly describe their API operations.

## 3. Implement form handling and authentication context [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Set up react-hook-form with Zod validation and authentication system
### Details:
Configure react-hook-form with Zod schema validation from packages/shared. Create reusable form components and validation patterns. Implement authentication context with login/logout functionality. Create protected route wrapper components. Set up error boundaries for global error handling. Follow authentication patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Form and authentication component names should clearly indicate their purpose and scope.
