# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement AI service integration backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Create AI-powered care plan and recommendation system
# Details:
Create AI service abstraction layer. Implement OpenAI and Anthropic provider integrations. Build care plan generation service. Create feeding plan optimization algorithms. Implement training progression suggestion engine. All AI integration logic must be self-documenting through clear service abstractions and method names.

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCES:**
- Configure AI provider API keys following docs/environment-variables.md security guidelines
- Implement DDD architecture with proper domain services as outlined in docs/project-plan.md Phase 1
- Use AAA testing pattern with proper mocking for external AI services per docs/testing-strategy.md

# Test Strategy:
AI services generate meaningful recommendations and care plans, comprehensive testing follows AAA pattern from docs/testing-strategy.md, and AI integration code is comment-free

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design AI service abstraction layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create abstract interfaces and base classes for AI service providers
### Details:
Design provider-agnostic interfaces for AI services. Create base abstract classes for chat completion, embeddings, and structured output. Define error handling patterns and response standardization. Implement configuration management for different AI providers. Follow DDD Domain Services patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Interface and class names should clearly indicate AI service capabilities.

## 2. Implement OpenAI provider integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Build OpenAI-specific implementation of AI service interfaces
### Details:
Implement OpenAI SDK integration. Build chat completion service with GPT models. Create structured output handlers using function calling. Implement error handling and rate limiting. Add configuration for API keys and model selection following docs/environment-variables.md security guidelines. Provider method names should clearly indicate OpenAI-specific operations.

## 3. Implement Anthropic provider integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Build Anthropic Claude-specific implementation of AI service interfaces
### Details:
Implement Anthropic SDK integration. Build Claude chat completion service. Create structured output handlers using tool use. Implement error handling and rate limiting. Add configuration for API keys and model selection following docs/environment-variables.md security guidelines. Provider method names should clearly indicate Anthropic-specific operations.

## 4. Build care plan generation algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Create AI-powered pet care plan generation service
### Details:
Design prompt templates for care plan generation based on pet profiles. Implement context processing to include pet health, age, breed, and medical history. Build structured output parsing for care recommendations. Create validation logic for generated plans. Follow DDD Domain Services patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Care plan method names should clearly indicate the type of care planning being performed.

## 5. Create feeding and training recommendation engines [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Implement AI services for feeding schedules and training progression
### Details:
Build feeding plan optimization using pet nutritional needs and activity levels. Create training progression algorithms based on pet behavior and learning patterns. Implement context-aware recommendations using historical data. Build feedback loops for recommendation improvement. Follow DDD Domain Services patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Recommendation method names should clearly describe the optimization criteria and target domain.
