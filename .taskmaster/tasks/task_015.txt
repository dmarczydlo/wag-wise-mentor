# Task ID: 15
# Title: Build analytics backend module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement data analytics and reporting system
# Details:
Create weight tracking analytics service. Implement growth prediction algorithms. Build breed comparison service. Create trend analysis and alerting system. Implement data aggregation for dashboards. All analytics algorithms must be self-documenting through clear naming and structure.

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCES:**
- Implement DDD architecture with proper domain analytics services as outlined in docs/project-plan.md Phase 1
- Follow environment configuration for any external analytics services from docs/environment-variables.md
- Use AAA testing pattern with in-memory data providers per docs/testing-strategy.md

# Test Strategy:
Analytics generate accurate insights and predictions, comprehensive testing follows AAA pattern from docs/testing-strategy.md, and analytics logic is comment-free

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create weight tracking analytics service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement service for analyzing puppy weight data and generating growth insights
### Details:
Build WeightAnalyticsService with methods for weight trend analysis, growth rate calculations, and weight milestone tracking. Include statistical functions for average weight by age/breed, growth velocity analysis, and weight percentile calculations. Integrate with puppy weight records from database. Follow DDD Domain Services patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Analytics method names should clearly indicate the type of weight analysis being performed.

## 2. Implement growth prediction algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to predict puppy growth patterns and adult size estimation
### Details:
Create GrowthPredictionService with machine learning or statistical models for predicting adult weight based on current growth patterns. Implement breed-specific growth curves and prediction accuracy metrics. Include confidence intervals and prediction validation against historical data. Follow DDD Domain Services patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Prediction method names should clearly describe the growth modeling approach and target metrics.

## 3. Build analytics aggregation and reporting endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Create API endpoints for analytics data aggregation and dashboard reporting
### Details:
Implement AnalyticsController with endpoints for breed comparison data, trend analysis results, and dashboard metrics. Create data aggregation services for generating summary statistics, alerts for unusual patterns, and export functionality for reports. Include caching for performance optimization. Follow DDD Application Layer patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Endpoint and aggregation method names should clearly indicate the type of analytics data being provided.
