# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement notification backend system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive notification system with multiple channels
# Details:
Create Supabase Edge Functions for notifications. Build notification scheduling service. Implement web push notification handlers. Create email notification service integration. Build notification preferences management. All notification logic must be self-explanatory through clear service and method names.

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCES:**
- Configure Supabase Edge Functions and service keys following docs/environment-variables.md security guidelines
- Implement DDD architecture with proper domain events as outlined in docs/project-plan.md Phase 1
- Use AAA testing pattern with proper mocking for external services per docs/testing-strategy.md

# Test Strategy:
Notifications send correctly via all channels, preferences are respected, comprehensive testing follows AAA pattern from docs/testing-strategy.md, and notification logic is comment-free

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Supabase Edge Functions for notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Edge Functions to handle notification processing and delivery
### Details:
Create Edge Functions for notification processing, webhook handling, and delivery coordination. Set up proper authentication and error handling. Configure service role keys following docs/environment-variables.md security guidelines. Follow DDD Infrastructure layer patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Function names should clearly indicate their notification processing purpose.

## 2. Implement notification scheduling service [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Build service to schedule and queue notifications for delivery
### Details:
Create scheduling logic for delayed notifications, recurring reminders, and batch processing. Implement queue management and priority handling. Follow DDD Domain Services patterns from docs/project-plan.md for business logic. Scheduling method names should clearly describe timing and priority logic.

## 3. Set up web push notification handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement web push notification infrastructure and handlers
### Details:
Configure VAPID keys, implement push notification subscription management, and create handlers for different notification types. Configure keys following docs/environment-variables.md security guidelines. Handler method names should indicate the type of push notification being processed.

## 4. Integrate email notification service [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Set up email delivery service and templates
### Details:
Integrate with email service provider, create email templates for different notification types, and implement delivery tracking. Configure API keys following docs/environment-variables.md security guidelines. Template and delivery method names should clearly indicate email purpose and delivery mechanism.

## 5. Build notification preferences management [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Create system for managing user notification preferences
### Details:
Implement preference storage, user interface integration, and respect for opt-out settings across all notification channels. Follow DDD Domain modeling patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Preference management methods should clearly indicate the type of preference being handled.

## 6. Create notification delivery tracking and retry logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Implement tracking and retry mechanisms for failed notifications
### Details:
Build delivery status tracking, implement exponential backoff retry logic, and create monitoring for notification success rates. Follow DDD Domain Services patterns from docs/project-plan.md. Retry and tracking method names should clearly describe their monitoring and retry strategies.
