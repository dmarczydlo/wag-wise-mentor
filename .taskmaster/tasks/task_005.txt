# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build authentication backend module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: critical
# Description: Create authentication system with Supabase integration
# Details:
Set up NestJS auth module structure with Supabase integration. Implement user authentication endpoints and guards. Build role-based access control system. All authentication logic must be self-documenting through clear naming and structure.

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCES:**
