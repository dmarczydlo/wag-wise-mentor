# Task ID: 6
# Title: Initialize NestJS backend structure with DDD architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create NestJS application in apps/backend with Domain-Driven Design architecture
# Details:
Use NestJS CLI to generate apps/backend/. Implement DDD architecture with Domain Layer (entities, value objects, domain services), Application Layer (use cases, application services), Infrastructure Layer (repositories, controllers, adapters). Configure dependency injection with proper abstraction layers. Set up Supabase client integration. Configure environment variables and CORS for frontend communication. All code must be self-documenting through clear naming and structure - no comments allowed except AAA comments in tests.

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCES:**
- Follow environment setup guidelines in docs/environment-variables.md for .env configuration, symlinks, and security considerations
- Implement all testing using AAA pattern as specified in docs/testing-strategy.md with Mocha + Chai and in-memory providers
- Adhere to DDD architecture principles and monorepo structure outlined in docs/project-plan.md Phase 1 requirements

# Test Strategy:
Backend starts successfully, DDD architecture is properly implemented, dependency injection works, comprehensive tests pass with AAA pattern using in-memory providers as per docs/testing-strategy.md, and all production code is comment-free

# Subtasks:
## 1. Generate NestJS application structure with DDD layers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use NestJS CLI to create the backend application with DDD architecture
### Details:
Run 'nest new backend' in apps/ directory. Create Domain Layer (src/domain/) with entities, value objects, and domain services. Create Application Layer (src/application/) with use cases and application services. Create Infrastructure Layer (src/infrastructure/) with repositories, controllers, and adapters. Configure dependency injection with proper abstraction layers. Follow docs/environment-variables.md for .env symlink setup and docs/project-plan.md DDD architecture guidelines. Remove all comments from production code - use clear method and variable names instead.

## 2. Create core module structure [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Generate and configure the main application modules for auth, puppies, calendar, training, ai, and analytics
### Details:
Use NestJS CLI to generate modules: nest g module auth, nest g module puppies, nest g module calendar, nest g module training, nest g module ai, nest g module analytics. Create basic service and controller files for each module. Configure module imports in app.module.ts. Follow DDD module organization patterns from docs/project-plan.md and implement proper testing setup per docs/testing-strategy.md. All production code must be self-documenting without comments.

## 3. Configure environment and external integrations [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Set up environment variables, Supabase client integration, and CORS configuration
### Details:
Create .env configuration files for development and production following docs/environment-variables.md guidelines. Install and configure @supabase/supabase-js client. Set up ConfigModule for environment variable management. Configure CORS settings in main.ts for frontend communication. Create Supabase service provider for database operations. Ensure all configuration follows security considerations from docs/environment-variables.md. Use descriptive variable and method names instead of comments.

## 4. Implement Supabase repository implementations for production [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create production-ready Supabase repository implementations for all modules (Auth, Puppy, Calendar, Training, AI, Analytics)
### Details:
Currently all modules use in-memory repositories which are only suitable for testing. Implement concrete Supabase repository classes that extend the abstract repository classes from the domain layer. Each repository must use the SupabaseService for database operations. Create supabase-user.repository.ts, supabase-puppy.repository.ts, supabase-event.repository.ts, supabase-training.repository.ts, supabase-ai.repository.ts, and supabase-analytics.repository.ts. Update module providers to use environment-based repository selection (InMemory for tests, Supabase for production). Map domain entities to/from Supabase table schemas. Implement proper error handling and transaction support. Follow DDD patterns from docs/project-plan.md and ensure all code is self-documenting without comments.
