# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement feeding backend module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create feeding schedules and tracking system
# Details:
Build feeding schedules controller. Create feeding logs tracking service. Implement weight-based portion calculation algorithms. Build food types and assignments management. Create feeding history aggregation endpoints. All calculation logic must be expressed through clear algorithm names and structure.

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCES:**
- Implement DDD architecture with proper Domain Layer business logic as specified in docs/project-plan.md Phase 1
- Follow environment configuration guidelines from docs/environment-variables.md for any external service integrations
- Use AAA testing pattern with in-memory providers for business logic testing per docs/testing-strategy.md

# Test Strategy:
Feeding schedules create correctly, portion calculations are accurate, comprehensive testing follows AAA pattern from docs/testing-strategy.md, and business logic is self-documenting

# Subtasks:
## 1. Build feeding schedules controller and management system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create REST API endpoints for feeding schedule CRUD operations and food type management
### Details:
Implement feeding schedules controller with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting feeding schedules. Build food types management system with CRUD operations for different food items. Create food assignments linking pets to specific food types. Include validation for schedule conflicts and proper error handling. Follow DDD Infrastructure layer patterns from docs/project-plan.md.

## 2. Implement feeding logs tracking service and portion calculations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create feeding logs tracking system with weight-based portion calculation algorithms
### Details:
Build feeding logs tracking service to record actual feeding events. Implement weight-based portion calculation algorithms that adjust serving sizes based on pet weight, age, and activity level. Create validation for feeding log entries and automatic portion recommendations. Include business logic for calculating optimal feeding amounts. Follow DDD Domain Services patterns from docs/project-plan.md.

## 3. Create feeding history aggregation endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Build API endpoints for feeding history reports and analytics
### Details:
Implement feeding history aggregation endpoints that provide comprehensive feeding analytics. Create endpoints for daily, weekly, and monthly feeding summaries. Build feeding pattern analysis and trend reporting. Include feeding compliance tracking and missed feeding alerts. Provide data export capabilities for feeding history. Follow DDD Application Layer patterns from docs/project-plan.md.
