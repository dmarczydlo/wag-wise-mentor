# Wag Wise Mentor - Comprehensive Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Wag Wise Mentor** is an AI-powered puppy care management platform built as a Bun-based monorepo with separated frontend and backend applications using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and comprehensive testing strategies.

**Mission**: Never miss a puppy care milestone. Smart feeding schedules, vet appointments, training guides, and AI-powered care plans that grow with your puppy.

## Task Processing Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All task processing must reference and follow these mandatory documents:

- **üìã [Architecture Documentation](./architecture.md)** - System design, component relationships, and technical decisions
- **üß™ [Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md)** - Comprehensive testing approach and patterns
- **‚öôÔ∏è [Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md)** - Configuration and environment setup
- **üìã [Project Plan](./project-plan.md)** - This document - complete roadmap and task management

These documents must be checked and referenced during all task processing to ensure consistency and adherence to project standards.

## Development Principles

The following principles must be followed throughout the entire development process:

### Core Development Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prioritize simplicity and clarity over complexity
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication through proper abstraction
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Structure code around business domains and use cases
- **Avoid Nested IF Statements**: Use early returns, guard clauses, and proper error handling instead of deeply nested conditionals
- **No Comments Policy**: Code should be self-documenting and readable without comments. Comments are considered an anti-pattern. Exception: AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) comments in tests are allowed for test structure clarity.

### Testing Philosophy

- **AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)**: Structure all tests with clear setup, execution, and verification phases
- **Behavior Testing Over Mocking**: Focus on testing actual behavior rather than implementation details
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all business logic, edge cases, and error conditions
- **In-Memory Providers**: Use in-memory implementations for testing to avoid external dependencies

### Code Quality Standards

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that explains itself through clear naming and structure
- **No Comments**: Avoid comments in production code - they indicate unclear code that needs refactoring
- **Exception - Test AAA Comments**: Only AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) comments are allowed in tests for structure clarity
- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive variable, function, and class names that express intent
- **Small Functions**: Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- **Clean Architecture**: Follow DDD principles with clear separation of concerns

## NX Monorepo Consideration

**Current**: Bun workspaces with simple dependency management
**Consideration**: NX for advanced monorepo features

**NX Benefits**:

- Advanced build caching and dependency graph
- Affected project detection
- Code generation and migration tools
- Better CI/CD integration
- Plugin ecosystem

**Migration Path**:

1. Evaluate current Bun workspace performance
2. Assess NX migration complexity
3. Consider hybrid approach (NX for build, Bun for runtime)
4. Plan gradual migration if beneficial

## Vercel Deployment Strategy

**Separate Projects**:

- `wag-wise-mentor-marketing` ‚Üí `wagwisementor.com`
- `wag-wise-mentor-app` ‚Üí `app.wagwisementor.com`

**Configuration**:

```json
// vercel.json for marketing
{
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/marketing && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/marketing/.next",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}

// vercel.json for app
{
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/frontend && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/frontend/dist",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All development work must follow proper Git workflow:

1. **Always Create Feature Branches**: Never commit directly to `main` branch
2. **Branch Naming Convention**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/auth-module`, `fix/dependency-injection`, `docs/update-testing-strategy`)
3. **Pull Request Process**: All changes must go through Pull Request review
4. **Branch Protection**: `main` branch should be protected and require PR approval

**Required Git Commands for Development**:

```bash
# 1. Create and checkout feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"

# 3. Push branch to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Create Pull Request via GitHub UI or CLI
# 5. After PR approval, merge to main
# 6. Delete feature branch after merge
```

**Branch Naming Conventions**:

- `feature/` - New features or major functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test-related changes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

**Commit Message Format**:

- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
- Examples:
  - `feat(auth): add user registration with email validation`
  - `fix(di): resolve abstract class injection issues`
  - `docs(testing): update Page Object Models documentation`

### Local Development

1. `bun install` - Install all dependencies
2. `bun run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
3. Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
4. Backend runs on http://localhost:3001

### Building for Production

1. `bun run build` - Build all packages and apps
2. `bun run test` - Run all tests
